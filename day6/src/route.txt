- Make a function that recognices if a character is repeated within 4 characters.
- If the character is repeated, go back to the position 1 and start again.
- Make the counter go to the length + 1 where it stoped. 
- counter2 is the one that says if we got the new marker. 
- If the counter2 (that represents the start-of-packet-marker) gets into 4, add +4 to counter, and that is the number of characters that are needed to be processed after finding the first
